      This study investigates the construction of discourse on digital inclusion
      in Sweden by closely analyzing policy reports from various governmental
      entities responsible for the digitalization agenda spanning the years 2017
      to 2023. The research forms a three-dimensional approach, which focuses on
      discursive motivations for bridging the digital divide, perceived access
      prerequisites for achieving this goal, and the primary target group for
      digital inclusion efforts within the policy discourse. Drawing upon van
      Dijk's Resources and Appropriation theory, the mezzo-scaleanalysis
      explores how properties of digital divides related to resource
      inequalities and adaptation were expressed within the discourse, forming
      the core framework of this thesis. Fairclough's critical discourse theory
      (CDA) guides the macro-scale analysis; however, the large-scale view, with
      a focus on power relations, is not the key framework in this study.
      Instead, they are drawn upon in the discussion section while evaluating
      the key findings.The methodology employed combines CDA through close
      reading with exploratory text mining techniques from the Digital
      Humanities, revealing three key discursive motivations: 1) social
      participation, 2) democracy and social equality, and 3) economic
      prosperity. Material/physical and skills access are identified as primary
      prerequisites, with a particular focus on people with disabilities. A
      critical evaluation of these findings provides significant implications
      for future research on the digital divide, particularly with regards to
      Swedish policymaking.
